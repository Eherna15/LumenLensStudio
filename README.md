# Lumen Lens Studio

Lumen Lens Studio is a photography portfolio website designed to showcase the artistry and professionalism of two photographers. The site includes a home page, gallery, and a contact form for inquiries. Visitors can navigate the site using a responsive side menu.


# How to run the website
Download the .zip file, extract all, then open the index.html file by double clicking the file. You should then be taken to your browser and on the website. 

If that does not work for you, you need to open the root folder, (the folder that contains the index.html, script.js, style.css, and the two other folders in it)
